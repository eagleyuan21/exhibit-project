# exhibit-project
This is the code for an autonomous functioning museum exhibit built using arduino in Matlab. 

The exhibit was targetted towards teaching health resiliency to age groups between 3rd and 5th grade.

A picture of the exhibit:

The exhibit has a motor and track located on the top of the exhibit that show progression, three buttons to play with the exhibit, and an ultrasonic sensor that acts as both a trigger to start and a restart for the exhibit.

Anywhere in the code with a ".jpg" file is where an image is projected onto the screen relevant to the story line of the exhibit.
